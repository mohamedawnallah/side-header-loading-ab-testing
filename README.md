# Side-Header Loading A/B Testing Experiments
This repository serves as a knowledge base documenting my A/B testing experiments. Here, I explore and evaluate various hypotheses, recording methodologies, results, and insights gained throughout the process.

## Hypotheses Across `filters_db/header-index` and `block_headers_bin`

## Conclusions

1. The permitted operations for side-loading are limited to either no-operation (no-op) or extending. This restriction is based on mutual trust, as established in the merge intervals algorithm and the process of overlapping checkpointing.
2. When side-loading block headers for a given range (e.g., blocks M to N), the corresponding filter headers for the same range (M to N) must also be provided. The **conjunction property** requires that both block headers and filter headers for the specified range are present and valid. The semantic mapping between block headers and filter headers is assumed to be correct and trusted; however, syntactic validation may still be performed during side-loading to ensure structural correctness.
3. The **idempotence property** ensures that performing the same side-loading operation multiple times has the same effect as performing it once. In other words, repeated application of a no-op or extending operation does not result in inconsistencies or unintended changes to the state.

## Rationale behind Conclusions

1. By explicitly disallowing replace, update, delete operations, and limiting actions to no-op or extending, the logic is simplified and the risk of inconsistencies or malicious behavior during side-loading is significantly reduced. Relying on mutual trust and well-defined procedures (such as merge intervals and overlapping checkpointing) allows the system to coordinate updates safely, while minimizing the attack surface and operational complexity.
2. Requiring both block headers and filter headers together ensures data consistency and prevents partial or mismatched data from being introduced during side-loading. This maintains the integrity of the chain state and ensures that all necessary components are available for downstream processing or validation.
3. Enforcing the idempotence property means that side-loading operations can be safely retried or repeated without concern for corrupting or altering the intended state. This increases robustness and fault tolerance in distributed or unreliable environments.

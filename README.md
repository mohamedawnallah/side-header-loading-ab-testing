# Side-Header Loading A/B Testing Experiments
This repository serves as a knowledge base documenting my A/B testing experiments. Here, I explore and evaluate various hypotheses, recording methodologies, results, and insights gained throughout the process.

## Hypotheses Across `filters_db/header-index` and `block_headers_bin`

| # | Header in `filters_db` | Header in `block_headers_bin` | Description                                                  | Variables                       | Default Outcome (`H₀`)                                         | Accepted or Rejected |
